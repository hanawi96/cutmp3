# ðŸŽ¯ CRITICAL FIX TEST: FadeOut Cursor Reset Bug

## THE EXACT ISSUE THAT WAS FIXED

**Problem:** When switching to fadeOut mode after music auto-pauses at region end, the cursor resets to 0 instead of returning to region start.

**Root Cause:** State mismatch in `volumeProfile` useEffect - when WaveSurfer auto-pauses but internal state still shows playing, the effect triggers with position 0.

**Fix Applied:** Modified volumeProfile useEffect to ALWAYS use `regionRef.current.start` when not playing, never 0.

## EXACT TEST SCENARIO

1. **Setup:**
   - Load any audio file
   - Set a region (e.g., 1.5s to 3.5s)
   - Start with "linear" volume profile

2. **Trigger the Bug (OLD BEHAVIOR):**
   - Click Play â†’ music starts at region start (1.5s)
   - Let music play to region end (3.5s) â†’ auto-pauses
   - Switch volume profile to "fadeOut"
   - **BUG:** Cursor jumps to 0s instead of staying at 1.5s

3. **Verify the Fix (NEW BEHAVIOR):**
   - Same steps as above
   - Switch volume profile to "fadeOut"
   - **FIXED:** Cursor stays at region start (1.5s) âœ…

## CONSOLE LOG VERIFICATION

Look for this log message when switching to fadeOut after auto-pause:
```
[volumeProfileChange] ðŸ”§ FIXED: Using region start X.XXXXs instead of 0 for stopped state
```

This confirms the fix is working correctly.

## CODE CHANGE SUMMARY

**File:** `WaveformSelector.jsx` lines ~220-250

**Before:**
```javascript
const currentPos = isWaveSurferActuallyPlaying ? 
  wavesurferRef.current.getCurrentTime() : 
  (syncPositionRef.current >= regionRef.current.start ? syncPositionRef.current : regionRef.current.start);
```

**After:**
```javascript
let currentPos;

if (isWaveSurferActuallyPlaying) {
  // Still playing - use current WaveSurfer position
  currentPos = wavesurferRef.current.getCurrentTime();
} else {
  // Not playing - ALWAYS use region start (never 0!)
  // This fixes the cursor reset bug when switching to fadeOut after auto-pause
  currentPos = regionRef.current.start;
  console.log(`[volumeProfileChange] ðŸ”§ FIXED: Using region start ${currentPos.toFixed(4)}s instead of 0 for stopped state`);
}
```

## TEST STATUS: âœ… READY FOR VERIFICATION

The fix has been applied. Please test the exact scenario above to confirm the cursor behavior is now correct.
