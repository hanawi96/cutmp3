# Realtime Auto-Seek Implementation - COMPLETED âœ…

## ðŸ“‹ IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

**Task:** Implement realtime auto-seek functionality during region dragging in MP3 cutter application.

**Goal:** When user drags region end while music is playing, the music should automatically seek to 3 seconds before the new region end position **realtime** (during the dragging process, not just at completion).

## âœ… COMPLETED CHANGES

### 1. Added New Refs for Realtime Drag Seeking
**Location:** `WaveformSelector.jsx` lines ~74-78
```javascript
// REALTIME DRAG SEEKING REFS
const isRealtimeDragSeekingRef = useRef(false); // Track if realtime drag seeking is active
const lastRealtimeSeekTimeRef = useRef(null); // Track last realtime seek time to prevent spam
const realtimeSeekThrottleRef = useRef(null); // Throttle realtime seeks
```

### 2. Enhanced "update" Event Handler
**Location:** `WaveformSelector.jsx` lines ~1432-1456
**Implementation:**
- Added realtime auto-seek logic before existing drag end handling
- Triggers when `isDraggingEnd` is true and `wasPlaying` is true
- Uses performance.now() for precise timing
- Throttles to 100ms minimum between realtime seeks
- Calculates preview position: `Math.max(newStart, newEnd - PREVIEW_TIME_BEFORE_END)`

### 3. Throttling and Performance
- **Throttle Interval:** 100ms minimum between realtime seeks
- **Performance Timer:** Uses `performance.now()` for precise timing
- **Auto Cleanup:** Clears realtime seeking flag after 200ms
- **Non-blocking:** Doesn't interfere with existing drag completion auto-seek

## ðŸŽ¯ HOW IT WORKS

### Before (Old Behavior):
1. User drags region end during playback
2. Auto-seek only happens when drag **completes**
3. Single auto-seek to 3 seconds before final position

### After (New Realtime Behavior):
1. User drags region end during playback
2. **REALTIME:** Auto-seek happens continuously during dragging
3. Every 100ms (throttled), seeks to 3 seconds before current drag position
4. When drag completes, existing auto-seek logic still works normally

## ðŸ“Š TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Event Flow:
```
Region End Drag Start
     â†“
"update" event fires continuously
     â†“
isDraggingEnd = true & wasPlaying = true
     â†“
Check throttle (100ms minimum)
     â†“
Calculate: Math.max(regionStart, draggedEnd - 3)
     â†“
Seek to preview position
     â†“
Continue until drag ends
     â†“
Existing drag completion auto-seek
```

### Constants Used:
- `PREVIEW_TIME_BEFORE_END = 3` (3 seconds preview)
- Throttle interval: 100ms
- Cleanup delay: 200ms

## ðŸ§ª TESTING

### Test File Created:
`test-realtime-autoseek.html` - Comprehensive testing instructions

### Key Test Steps:
1. Upload MP3 file (30+ seconds recommended)
2. Set region: 0s to ~10s
3. Start playback
4. **CRITICAL:** While playing at ~5s, slowly drag RIGHT EDGE to 20s
5. Observe continuous console messages during drag

### Expected Console Output:
```
ðŸ”„ [REALTIME AUTO-SEEK] Seeking to 12.0000s (3s before end: 15.0000s)
ðŸ”„ [REALTIME AUTO-SEEK] Seeking to 13.0000s (3s before end: 16.0000s)
ðŸ”„ [REALTIME AUTO-SEEK] Seeking to 14.0000s (3s before end: 17.0000s)
-- Multiple messages during dragging! --
```

## âœ… VERIFICATION POINTS

- [x] New refs added for realtime drag seeking tracking
- [x] Realtime auto-seek logic added to "update" event handler
- [x] Throttling implemented (100ms minimum)
- [x] Performance optimized with performance.now()
- [x] Auto cleanup with timeout
- [x] Preserves existing drag completion auto-seek
- [x] Console logging for debugging
- [x] Test documentation created

## ðŸŽµ USER EXPERIENCE

**Before:** User had to complete drag operation to get auto-seek
**After:** User gets immediate, continuous feedback as they drag - music follows their dragging in realtime

This creates a much more intuitive and responsive editing experience!

## ðŸ”§ IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: COMPLETE âœ…

The realtime auto-seek functionality has been successfully implemented and is ready for testing. Users can now enjoy seamless, real-time audio seeking while dragging region endpoints.
